# EcoShift Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from eco-conscious apps like Nest, Tesla Energy, and sustainability-focused interfaces. The design balances utility (energy data visualization) with engaging gamification elements.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Forest Green: 142 45% 35% (primary brand color)
- Ocean Blue: 200 60% 45% (secondary brand)
- Sage Green: 120 25% 75% (light backgrounds)

**Supporting Colors:**
- Earth Brown: 25 35% 25% (grounding elements)
- Energy Orange: 35 80% 60% (accent for alerts/RED periods)
- Clean White: 0 0% 98% (backgrounds)
- Charcoal: 220 15% 20% (text, dark mode primary)

**Eco Band Colors:**
- GREEN periods: 142 60% 50%
- BLUE periods: 200 55% 55%
- ORANGE periods: 35 75% 60%
- RED periods: 0 70% 55%

### B. Typography
**Primary Font:** Inter (Google Fonts)
- Headers: 600 weight, sizes 24px-48px
- Body text: 400 weight, 16px base
- Data displays: 500 weight, tabular numbers

**Secondary Font:** Outfit (Google Fonts) for accent elements and gamification features

### C. Layout System
**Tailwind Spacing:** Consistent use of units 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16
- Component padding: p-6, p-8
- Section margins: mb-8, mb-12
- Element gaps: gap-4, gap-6
- Grid layouts: 12-column responsive grid

### D. Component Library

**Navigation:**
- Clean horizontal nav with eco-inspired iconography
- Breadcrumb navigation for multi-step flows
- Subtle green accent on active states

**Data Visualization:**
- 24-hour timeline with smooth color transitions
- Card-based appliance selector with power consumption badges
- Progress indicators for savings goals
- Interactive tooltips with energy data

**Forms & Controls:**
- Rounded input fields (rounded-lg)
- Toggle switches for appliance on/off states
- Time picker with eco band context
- Slider controls for usage duration

**Gamification Elements:**
- EcoPoints counter with leaf icon animation
- Achievement badges with subtle glow effects
- Savings meter with gradient fill
- Progress rings for daily/weekly goals

**Overlays:**
- Modal dialogs for appliance details
- Toast notifications for savings alerts
- Contextual help posters with AI recommendations

### E. Visual Treatments

**Gradients:**
- Hero sections: Soft green to blue gradient (142 45% 35% to 200 60% 45%)
- Card highlights: Subtle sage gradient overlays
- Button states: Energy orange to deeper orange progression

**Background Patterns:**
- Subtle geometric patterns suggesting energy flow
- Light texture overlays on data visualization areas
- Clean sections with alternating white/sage backgrounds

## Key Design Principles

1. **Sustainability First:** Visual metaphors reinforce eco-consciousness
2. **Data Clarity:** Complex energy data presented simply and intuitively
3. **Positive Reinforcement:** Gamification encourages continued engagement
4. **Accessibility:** High contrast ratios, clear typography, intuitive navigation
5. **Performance:** Lightweight animations, efficient data loading states

## Images
No large hero image required. Focus on:
- Small appliance icons (integrated from icon library)
- Chart visualizations for data display
- Achievement badge graphics for gamification
- Optional: Small eco-themed accent graphics (leaves, energy symbols)

The design emphasizes clean data visualization over decorative imagery, maintaining focus on functionality while creating an engaging, eco-conscious user experience.
